# TRACKS

Monte Carlo particles' tracks generation and reconstruction with multiple scattering and noise. Developed by Luca Quaglia and Mattia Ivaldi - Torino, 2018.  

TRACKS requires a working version of ROOT on your device. It has an easy 3-steps usage:
1. open and edit the file _detector_info.txt_ with the format  
`layer_name width radius thickness theta_rms`

2. open and edit the tracks.C macro with your preferences  
`gROOT->ProcessLine(“tracks_gen(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h)”)` where  
bool a = verbose mode ON/OFF  
bool b = print and save plots ON/OFF  
bool c = multiple scattering ON/OFF    
bool d = noise ON/OFF  
int e = 5 custom z, 10 custom multiplicity, 15 both custom  
int f = # of collisions performed  
double g = custom vertex z  
double h = custom event multiplicity  
`gROOT->ProcessLine(“tracks_reco(a,b,c,d,e,f)”)` where  
bool a = verbose mode ON/OFF  
bool b = print and save plots ON/OFF  
double c = smearing parameter on z  
double d = smearing parameter on phi  
double e = ambiguity check amplitude  
int f = ambiguity check width

3. open a ROOT session and interpret root [0] .x tracks.C

By default the lines 30 and 31 of tracks.C are commented, if you want to perform a performances study you just need to uncomment these lines and edit the spit_perform.C and cluster_study.C macros.

The generated data will be stored in the _gen.root_ file, the reconstruction plots will be stored in the _reco.root_ file, the performances plots will be stored in the _perform.root_file. All the plots are anyway saved in .eps format in the tracksplot folder.

Caveat! When you use TRACKS do pay attention to time and CPU efficiency, the software operates with the following performances:
